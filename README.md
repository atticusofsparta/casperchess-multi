 casper chess multiplayer
 
 I was unable to finish the multiplayer functionality in time. I will continue to work on it though.
 
 to run the app, run ```npm install```
 then run ```nodemon server.js```
 then open another terminal and run ```npm start```
 
 app should be running on localhost:3000 and server should be running on localhost:6100
